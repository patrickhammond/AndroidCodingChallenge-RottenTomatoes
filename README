- setListAdapter vs getListView().setAdapter() in a ListFragment
  use the first...the second will cost you time

image cache living in the application scope = bad idea
serializable vs parcelable
listfragment loading transition on rotate displays which is deceiving



- binding adapter could be better
- would be nice for the viewholder to be tightly bound to a view...lost 10 min because I was still referrencing an old view

- parceler has compile errors...not sure why.  Better than using serializible

- figure out "not a fragment issues" based on what a fragment extends
  had a scrollview in one, not in the other, weird crashes

- scrollable list of movies with thumbnails
- with a detail view
- using fragments
- persist data (sure...but via HTTP caching)
- with landscape orientation for the detail view
- "cache" for images, yep...but done poorly
last box office movies saved on rotate
- API timeouts tonight were annoying and killed 10-15 min thinking it was me

- No infinite scrolling...out of time
  - CWAC endless adapter to the rescue
